for id ac-1, the checkbox
when ngclick have it open the one corresponding to unique id from dates collection
each day will have its own id

the id ac-1 will probably have to be set to the id from the dates too


will need to set up .when
first for the days monday-sunday
which will be like /id 
and another for the meals, breakfast lunch dinner
which will be like /id/id+1 /id/id+2 and /id/id+3


will need to use 'this' selector so it knows for the thing i clicked on



somehow the id needs to increment in the ng repeat so the days are not static to monday

need to create a function for ng-click that when clicked sets....tbc





for the Add button
ng click call function

need an input 
need make a variable equal to inputs text
function will add input text to database
